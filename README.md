# Task managment web React App

## Melissa Rainey

# Overview / description of the project 

   I've created an Web App to collect  a list of ToDo items and well as contact information from users. 
  

## Details on use and functionality 

   THis is an App that allows the  user to choose or create options for individual areas of grooming for their Doodle. Broken down into ears,tail,head,body and feet. They can choose to have areas left natural as well. The contact page offers a comment/ doode type field where owners can explain what is important for their doodle's groom based on type of doodle they own.


# Technologies used include:
   (CSS, React and Jsvascript)


## Ideas for future improvement.
 
  1. A Pricing list 
  2. A way to schedule the appointment 
  3. Profiles of the stylists
